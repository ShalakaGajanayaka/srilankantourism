feat: Convert HTML template to React with routing and component structure

This commit establishes the foundation for converting the HTML tourism template
to a React application with modern routing and component architecture.

Major changes:
- Copy all assets (CSS, JS, images, fonts) from html/assets to frontend/public/assets
- Install and configure React Router DOM for client-side routing
- Create reusable Layout component with Header and Footer
- Convert main Home page with hero section, search tabs, and package listings
- Set up route structure for all major pages (About, Contact, Tours, Hotels, etc.)
- Update index.html to load template CSS and JavaScript files
- Create placeholder page components for remaining HTML pages
- Update CSS imports to use template styles from public/assets

Components created:
- Header.jsx: Navigation header with dropdown menus, search, theme toggle
- Footer.jsx: Footer with links, newsletter subscription, contact info
- Layout.jsx: Wrapper component that includes Header and Footer for all pages
- Home.jsx: Main landing page with hero video, search functionality, packages

Pages initialized:
- Home, About, Contact, TourList, HotelList, Destination
- TransportsList, RestaurantList, News, Faq, Dashboard
- TourCart, Login, Register, PrivacyPolicy, TermsCondition
- DetailsWithSlider

Technical improvements:
- Replace HTML anchor tags with React Router Links
- Convert HTML class attributes to React className
- Update asset paths to use /assets/ prefix for public folder
- Clean up default Vite CSS to allow template styles to work
- Add theme switching functionality in Header component
- Preserve all template JavaScript functionality through public assets

Next steps:
- Convert remaining HTML page content to React components
- Add interactive functionality with React hooks where needed
- Implement form handling for booking and contact pages
- Add state management for cart and user authentication

BREAKING CHANGE: None - this is initial setup for HTML template conversion
